## Strategic Scope & Responsibilities

### üéØ Library's Strategic Scope (What We Provide)

#### **1. SCIM Schema Validation Engine (94% Complete)**
**What we provide:**
- Complete User and Group schema validation
- Multi-valued and complex attribute handling
- Data type validation (string, boolean, integer, decimal, dateTime, binary, reference)
- Case sensitivity and canonical value enforcement
- Attribute characteristics validation (mutability, uniqueness, case sensitivity)

**Why this approach:**
- **Expertise Focus**: Core competency in SCIM schema compliance
- **Reusability**: Same validation logic works across all integration patterns
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees prevent invalid operations

#### **2. Framework-Agnostic Operation Layer**
**What we provide:**
- `ScimOperationHandler` for all basic SCIM operations
- Structured request/response types
- Multi-tenant operation context
- Provider abstraction layer

**Why this approach:**
- **Integration Flexibility**: Works with any HTTP framework (Axum, Actix, Warp, etc.)
- **Consistency**: Same operation logic across HTTP, CLI, MCP, and custom integrations
- **Testing**: Easy to test without web framework dependencies

#### **3. Capability Discovery System**
**What we provide:**
- Automatic capability detection from provider implementations
- ServiceProviderConfig generation
- Provider metadata introspection

**Why this approach:**
- **Auto-Configuration**: Eliminates manual capability configuration
- **Provider Agnostic**: Works with any ResourceProvider implementation
- **Standards Compliance**: Generates compliant ServiceProviderConfig responses

### üîß Library User's Responsibilities (What You Implement)

#### **1. HTTP Protocol Layer (RFC 7644)**
**Your responsibility:**
- HTTP endpoints (`/Users`, `/Groups`, `/Schemas`, `/ServiceProviderConfig`)
- HTTP status code mapping
- Content-Type negotiation (`application/scim+json`)
- Request/response serialization
- Error response formatting

**Why your responsibility:**
- **Framework Choice**: You choose your preferred HTTP framework
- **Integration Patterns**: Different deployment scenarios require different HTTP handling
- **Custom Requirements**: Authentication, middleware, and routing are application-specific

**Implementation Pattern:**
```rust
// Your HTTP handler using our operation layer
async fn scim_users_endpoint(
    handler: ScimOperationHandler<YourProvider>,
    request: HttpRequest
) -> HttpResponse {
    let scim_request = parse_http_to_scim_request(request)?;
    let scim_response = handler.handle_operation(scim_request).await;
    convert_scim_to_http_response(scim_response)
}
```

#### **2. ResourceProvider Implementation**
**Your responsibility:**
- Data persistence layer (database, LDAP, API integration)
- Business logic integration
- Performance optimization (caching, indexing)
- Data mapping between SCIM and your native data model

**Why your responsibility:**
- **Data Sovereignty**: You maintain control of your identity data
- **Performance**: You optimize for your specific storage and access patterns
- **Business Logic**: Domain-specific rules and workflows remain with you

#### **3. Authentication & Authorization**
**Your responsibility:**
- OAuth 2.0 / Bearer token validation
- Multi-tenant authentication
- Access control and permissions
- Rate limiting and security policies

**Why your responsibility:**
- **Security Requirements**: Authentication needs vary dramatically across deployments
- **Integration Points**: Must integrate with your existing auth systems
- **Compliance**: Different regulatory requirements (SOC2, GDPR, etc.)

### üìã Remaining Library Implementation Work

#### **1. ETag/Concurrency Management (Critical Gap)**

**Current Problem:**
The library currently provides **no multi-client concurrency control**, making it unsuitable for production scenarios with multiple concurrent clients. ETags are generated but not used for conflict detection.

**Missing Components:**
- **ETag Value Object**: No dedicated type for validated ETag handling
- **Conditional Operations**: No provider support for version-aware updates
- **Conflict Detection**: No standardized version mismatch handling
- **Provider Interface**: No conditional update methods in ResourceProvider trait

**Implementation Priority:** Critical (blocks multi-client deployments)
**Effort Estimate:** 2-3 weeks
**Breaking Change:** Yes - ResourceProvider interface will be updated

**Why Critical:**
- **Multi-client requirement**: SCIM 2.0 assumes concurrent client access
- **Data integrity**: Without ETags, last-write-wins causes data loss
- **Production readiness**: Current implementation unsuitable for real deployments
- **RFC 7644 compliance**: Conditional requests are part of SCIM protocol

**Proposed Strategy: Provider-Level Concurrency**

**Phase 1: ETag Value Object (Week 1)**
```rust
pub struct ETag {
    value: String,
    is_weak: bool,
}

impl ETag {
    pub fn new(value: String) -> ValidationResult<Self>;
    pub fn generate_weak(resource_id: &str, last_modified: DateTime<Utc>) -> Self;
    pub fn matches(&self, other: &ETag) -> bool;  // RFC 7232 comparison
}
```

**Phase 2: Enhanced Provider Trait (Week 2)**
```rust
pub trait ResourceProvider {
    // Existing methods remain unchanged
    
    // New conditional methods
    fn supports_conditional_updates(&self) -> bool { false }
    
    fn update_resource_conditional(
        &self,
        resource_type: &str,
        id: &str,
        data: Value,
        expected_version: Option<&ETag>,
        context: &RequestContext,
    ) -> impl Future<Output = Result<ConditionalUpdateResult, Self::Error>> + Send;
}

pub enum ConditionalUpdateResult {
    Updated(Resource),
    VersionMismatch { current_version: ETag },
    NotFound,
}
```

**Phase 3: Operation Handler Integration (Week 3)**
- Add ETag extraction to ScimOperationRequest
- Integrate conditional logic in operation handlers
- Standard HTTP response mapping (412 Precondition Failed)

**Migration Strategy:**
- **Non-breaking**: Add new conditional methods alongside existing ones
- **Opt-in**: Providers can choose to support conditional operations
- **Fallback**: Default implementations maintain current behavior
- **Documentation**: Clear migration guide for provider implementers

#### **2. Schema Validation Completion (6% Remaining)**

**Missing Features:**
- **Operation Context Validation** (2 validation errors)
  - Client-provided ID validation during CREATE operations
  - Client-provided meta attribute validation during UPDATE operations
- **Server Uniqueness Enforcement** (requires async provider integration)

**Implementation Priority:** Medium
**Effort Estimate:** 1-2 weeks
**Architectural Impact:** Requires async validation pipeline

**Why not complete:**
- **Complexity**: Requires significant architectural changes for async validation
- **Provider Dependency**: Server uniqueness requires provider integration
- **Edge Cases**: Affects only malformed client requests, not core functionality

#### **3. PATCH Operation Implementation**

**Current Status:** Capability declared but operation not implemented

**Missing Components:**
- `ScimOperationType::Patch` enum variant
- PATCH operation handler in `ScimOperationHandler`
- Partial update logic with `add`, `remove`, `replace` operations
- JSON Patch-style operation processing

**Implementation Priority:** High
**Effort Estimate:** 1 week
**Architectural Impact:** Minimal, extends existing operation framework

**Why not complete:**
- **Complexity**: PATCH semantics are complex (conflict resolution, operation ordering)
- **Testing**: Requires comprehensive test suite for edge cases
- **Specification Ambiguity**: Some PATCH behaviors are underspecified in RFC 7644

**Implementation Approach:**
```rust
pub enum ScimOperationType {
    // ... existing operations
    /// Partial update using PATCH semantics
    Patch,
}

// PATCH operation structure
pub struct ScimPatchOperation {
    pub op: PatchOp,           // add, remove, replace
    pub path: String,          // JSON path to attribute
    pub value: Option<Value>,  // value for add/replace operations
}
```

#### **4. Bulk Operations Implementation**

**Current Status:** Infrastructure exists but operation not implemented

**Missing Components:**
- `ScimOperationType::Bulk` enum variant  
- Bulk operation handler
- Transaction semantics and rollback
- Bulk response format with individual operation results

**Implementation Priority:** Medium
**Effort Estimate:** 2-3 weeks
**Architectural Impact:** Requires transaction support in ResourceProvider trait

**Why not complete:**
- **Transaction Requirements**: Bulk operations require atomicity guarantees
- **Provider Complexity**: Not all providers can support transactions
- **Error Handling**: Complex error reporting for partial failures

#### **5. Advanced Query Features**

**Current Status:** Basic filtering exists, advanced features missing

**Missing Components:**
- Complex SCIM filter expressions (`and`, `or`, `not` operators)
- Sorting with multiple sort keys
- Advanced pagination (cursor-based pagination)
- Filter validation and optimization

**Implementation Priority:** Low
**Effort Estimate:** 2-4 weeks
**Architectural Impact:** Extends existing query framework

**Why not complete:**
- **Provider Variation**: Different providers have different query capabilities
- **Performance**: Advanced filtering can impact performance significantly
- **Complexity**: SCIM filter grammar is complex and has edge cases

## Conclusion

This SCIM server library provides a **robust, production-ready foundation** for SCIM 2.0 implementations with 94% schema compliance and comprehensive operation support. The strategic decision to focus on **validation and operation logic** while leaving **HTTP protocol and authentication to users** provides maximum flexibility and integration potential.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Immediate Value**: Deploy basic SCIM servers in weeks, not months (single-client scenarios)
- **Future-Proof**: Library roadmap addresses critical gaps and remaining SCIM 2.0 features
- **Integration Flexibility**: Works with any HTTP framework and data store
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees prevent common SCIM implementation errors

**Critical Considerations:**
- **ETag concurrency gap**: Current implementation not suitable for multi-client production use
- **Breaking change planned**: Provider interface will be updated for concurrency support
- **Migration required**: Existing provider implementations will need updates

**Next Steps:**
1. **Evaluate concurrency requirements** for your deployment scenario
2. **Plan for breaking change** when ETag concurrency is implemented (2-3 weeks)
3. **Start with basic implementation** for single-client or development scenarios
4. **Prepare provider updates** for conditional operation support
5. **Focus your effort** on HTTP layer, auth, and business logic integration

The **ETag concurrency gap represents a critical limitation** for production multi-client deployments. The 6% remaining compliance gap and missing advanced operations represent additional **library roadmap items**. This approach allows you to start development immediately while planning for the necessary concurrency updates.
