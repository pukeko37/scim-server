# Schema Mechanisms in SCIM Server

This chapter explores how the SCIM Server library implements the schema concepts defined in the SCIM protocol. While [Understanding SCIM Schemas](./schemas.md) covers the protocol specifications, this chapter focuses on the conceptual mechanisms that make schema processing practical and type-safe in Rust applications.

See the [Schema API documentation](https://docs.rs/scim-server/latest/scim_server/schema/index.html) for complete details.

The SCIM Server library transforms the abstract schema definitions from RFC 7643 into concrete, composable components that provide compile-time safety, runtime validation, and seamless integration with Rust's type system.

## Schema Registry

The [Schema Registry](https://docs.rs/scim-server/latest/scim_server/schema/struct.SchemaRegistry.html) serves as the central schema management system within SCIM Server. It acts as a knowledge base that holds all schema definitions and provides validation services throughout the request lifecycle.

**Core Concept**: Rather than parsing schemas repeatedly or maintaining scattered validation logic, the Schema Registry centralizes all schema knowledge in a single, queryable component. It comes pre-loaded with RFC 7643 core schemas (User, Group, Enterprise User extension) and supports dynamic registration of custom schemas at runtime.

The registry operates as a validation oracle—when any component needs to understand attribute constraints, validate data structures, or determine response formatting, it queries the registry. This creates a single source of truth for schema behavior across the entire system.

**Integration Points**: The registry integrates with every major operation—resource creation validates against registered schemas, query processing checks attribute names, and response formatting respects schema-defined visibility rules.

*For detailed API reference, see the [SchemaRegistry documentation](https://docs.rs/scim-server/latest/scim_server/schema/struct.SchemaRegistry.html).*

## Value Objects

[Value Objects](https://docs.rs/scim-server/latest/scim_server/schema/trait.ValueObject.html) provide compile-time type safety for SCIM attributes by wrapping primitive values in domain-specific types. This mechanism prevents common errors like assigning invalid email addresses or constructing malformed names.

**Core Concept**: Instead of working with raw JSON values that can contain any data, Value Objects create typed wrappers that enforce validation at construction time. An `Email` value object can only be created with a valid email string, and a `UserName` can only contain characters that meet SCIM requirements.

This approach leverages Rust's ownership system to make invalid states unrepresentable. Once you have a `DisplayName` value object, you know it contains valid display name data—no runtime checks needed. The type system becomes your validation mechanism.

**Schema Integration**: Value objects understand their corresponding [schema definitions](https://docs.rs/scim-server/latest/scim_server/schema/struct.AttributeDefinition.html). They know their attribute type, validation rules, and serialization requirements. When converting to JSON for API responses, they automatically apply schema-defined formatting and constraints.

**Extensibility**: The value object system supports both pre-built types for common SCIM attributes and custom value objects for organization-specific extensions. The [factory pattern](https://docs.rs/scim-server/latest/scim_server/schema/trait.SchemaConstructible.html) allows dynamic creation while maintaining type safety.

*For implementation details, see the [ValueObject trait documentation](https://docs.rs/scim-server/latest/scim_server/schema/trait.ValueObject.html).*

## Dynamic Schema Construction

Dynamic Schema Construction addresses the challenge of working with schemas that are not known at compile time—such as tenant-specific extensions or runtime-configured resource types.

**Core Concept**: While value objects provide compile-time safety for known schemas, dynamic construction enables runtime flexibility for unknown or variable schemas. The system can examine a schema definition at runtime and create appropriate value objects and validation logic on demand.

This mechanism uses a factory pattern where schema definitions drive object creation. Given a schema's attribute definition and a JSON value, the system can construct the appropriate typed representation without prior knowledge of the specific schema structure.

**Schema-Driven Behavior**: The construction process respects all schema constraints—required attributes, data types, multi-valued rules, and custom validation logic. The resulting objects behave identically to compile-time created value objects, maintaining consistency across static and dynamic scenarios.

**Use Cases**: This enables multi-tenant systems where each tenant may have custom schemas, AI integration where schemas are discovered at runtime, and administrative tools that work with arbitrary SCIM resource types.

*For advanced usage patterns, see the [SchemaConstructible trait documentation](https://docs.rs/scim-server/latest/scim_server/schema/trait.SchemaConstructible.html).*

## Validation Pipeline

The [Validation Pipeline](https://docs.rs/scim-server/latest/scim_server/schema/index.html#validation) orchestrates multi-layered validation that progresses from basic syntax checking to complex business rule enforcement. This mechanism ensures that only valid, schema-compliant data enters your system.

**Core Concept**: Rather than ad-hoc validation scattered throughout the codebase, the pipeline provides a structured, configurable validation process. Each layer builds on the previous one—syntax validation ensures basic JSON correctness, schema validation checks SCIM compliance, and business validation enforces organizational rules.

The pipeline integrates with HTTP operations, applying operation-specific validation rules. A POST request validates required attributes, while a PATCH request validates path expressions and mutability constraints.

**Validation Context**: The pipeline operates within a context that includes the target schema, HTTP operation type, tenant information, and existing resource state. This context enables sophisticated validation logic that considers the complete request environment.

**Error Handling**: Validation failures produce structured errors with appropriate HTTP status codes and detailed messages. The pipeline can collect multiple errors in a single pass, providing comprehensive feedback rather than stopping at the first issue.

*For error handling strategies and custom validation rules, see the [Validation Guide](../how-to/validation.md).*

## Auto Schema Discovery

Auto Schema Discovery provides SCIM-compliant endpoints that expose available schemas and resource types to clients and tools. This mechanism enables runtime introspection of server capabilities.

**Core Concept**: The discovery system automatically generates schema and resource type information from the registered schemas in the Schema Registry. Clients can query `/Schemas` and `/ResourceTypes` endpoints to understand what resources are available and how they're structured.

This creates a self-documenting API where tools and AI agents can discover capabilities dynamically rather than requiring pre-configured knowledge of the server's schema support.

**Standards Compliance**: The discovery endpoints conform to RFC 7644 specifications, ensuring compatibility with standard SCIM clients and identity providers. The generated responses include all required metadata for proper client integration.

*For endpoint configuration and custom resource type registration, see the [REST API Guide](../reference/rest-endpoints.md).*

## AI Integration

AI Integration makes SCIM operations accessible to artificial intelligence agents through structured, schema-aware tool descriptions. This mechanism transforms SCIM Server capabilities into AI-consumable formats.

**Core Concept**: The integration generates Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool descriptions that include schema constraints, validation rules, and example usage patterns. AI agents receive structured information about what operations are available and how to use them correctly.

Schema awareness ensures that AI tools understand not just the API surface but the data validation requirements, making them more likely to generate valid requests and handle errors appropriately.

**Dynamic Capabilities**: The AI integration reflects the current server configuration, including custom schemas and tenant-specific extensions. As schemas are added or modified, the AI tools automatically update to reflect new capabilities.

*For AI agent configuration and custom tool creation, see the [AI Integration Guide](../advanced/ai-integration.md).*

## Component Relationships

These mechanisms work together to create a cohesive schema processing system:

- **Schema Registry** provides the authoritative schema definitions
- **Value Objects** implement type-safe attribute handling based on registry schemas  
- **Dynamic Construction** creates value objects from registry definitions at runtime
- **Validation Pipeline** uses registry schemas to enforce compliance
- **Auto Discovery** exposes registry contents through SCIM endpoints
- **AI Integration** translates registry capabilities into agent-readable formats

This architecture ensures that schema knowledge flows consistently throughout the system, from initial registration through final API responses.

## Extensibility and Customization

Each mechanism supports extension while maintaining SCIM compliance:

- **Custom Schemas** integrate seamlessly with the registry system
- **Domain-Specific Value Objects** extend the type safety model
- **Business Validation Rules** plug into the validation pipeline
- **Tenant-Specific Behavior** works across all mechanisms
- **Custom AI Tools** can be generated from schema definitions

The key principle is additive customization—you extend capabilities without modifying core behavior, ensuring that standard SCIM operations continue to work while supporting organization-specific requirements.

## Production Considerations

These mechanisms are designed for production deployment:

- **Performance**: Schema processing is optimized for minimal runtime overhead
- **Memory Efficiency**: Schema definitions are shared across requests and tenants
- **Thread Safety**: All mechanisms support concurrent access without locking
- **Error Recovery**: Validation failures don't impact server stability
- **Observability**: Schema processing integrates with structured logging

*For deployment and monitoring guidance, see the [Production Deployment Guide](../deployment/production.md).*
