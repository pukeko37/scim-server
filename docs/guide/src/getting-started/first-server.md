# Your First SCIM Server

This tutorial will guide you through creating and running your first SCIM server from scratch.

## Overview

### What You'll Build

- A basic SCIM server with user management
- RESTful API endpoints following SCIM 2.0 specification
- Basic authentication and authorization
- Simple data persistence

### Learning Objectives

- Understand SCIM server fundamentals
- Learn the basic API structure
- Configure essential server components
- Test your server implementation

## Creating Your First Server

### Project Setup

#### Initialize a New Project

Steps to create a new Rust project for your SCIM server.

#### Add Dependencies

Required crates and their configurations in `Cargo.toml`.

#### Project Structure

Recommended directory layout and file organization.

### Basic Server Implementation

#### Main Server Setup

- Creating the HTTP server
- Configuring routes and middleware
- Setting up the application context

#### SCIM Schema Definition

- Defining user and group schemas
- Implementing core SCIM attributes
- Custom schema extensions

#### Resource Endpoints

##### User Management

- Create user endpoint
- Read user endpoint
- Update user endpoint
- Delete user endpoint
- List users with filtering

##### Group Management

- Create group endpoint
- Read group endpoint
- Update group endpoint
- Delete group endpoint
- List groups with filtering

### Data Layer

#### In-Memory Storage

Simple in-memory data store for development and testing.

#### Database Integration

- Database connection setup
- Entity models
- Repository pattern implementation

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Basic Authentication

Simple username/password authentication setup.

#### Bearer Token Authentication

JWT or API key-based authentication.

#### Authorization Policies

Role-based access control and resource permissions.

## Configuration

### Server Configuration

- Port and host settings
- CORS configuration
- Request/response middleware

### SCIM Configuration

- Service provider configuration
- Supported features and operations
- Schema definitions

### Logging and Monitoring

- Log level configuration
- Request/response logging
- Health check endpoints

## Testing Your Server

### Manual Testing

#### Using curl Commands

Example curl commands to test each endpoint.

#### Using Postman/Insomnia

Import collections and environment setup.

### Automated Testing

#### Unit Tests

Testing individual components and functions.

#### Integration Tests

End-to-end API testing scenarios.

### SCIM Compliance Testing

Tools and techniques for validating SCIM 2.0 compliance.

## Running the Server

### Development Mode

- Running with hot reload
- Debug configuration
- Development tools

### Production Deployment

#### Basic Deployment

Simple production deployment setup.

#### Docker Deployment

Containerization and orchestration.

#### Environment Configuration

Production environment variables and settings.
