# SCIM Server Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for the SCIM Server library! This guide will take you from initial setup to advanced usage patterns, helping you build robust identity provisioning systems with Rust.

## What is SCIM Server?

SCIM Server is a comprehensive Rust library that implements the SCIM 2.0 (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) protocol. It provides a type-safe, high-performance foundation for building identity provisioning and management systems.

### Why SCIM?

SCIM is the industry standard for automating user provisioning between identity providers and applications. Instead of building custom APIs for user management, SCIM provides:

- **Standardized Operations**: Consistent CRUD operations across all systems
- **Rich Filtering**: Powerful query capabilities for finding users and groups
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient handling of large-scale provisioning tasks
- **Schema Validation**: Automatic validation against well-defined schemas
- **Interoperability**: Works with existing identity providers and applications

### Why This Library?

The SCIM Server library takes SCIM implementation to the next level with:

- **🛡️ Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system to prevent runtime errors
- **🏢 Multi-Tenancy**: Built-in support for multiple organizations
- **⚡ Performance**: Async-first design with minimal overhead
- **🔌 Flexibility**: Framework-agnostic with pluggable storage
- **🤖 AI Integration**: Built-in Model Context Protocol support
- **🔄 Concurrency Control**: ETag-based optimistic locking

## Architecture Overview

The SCIM Server follows a clean three-layer architecture:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   HTTP Layer    │    │   SCIM Server    │    │   Storage       │
│                 │    │                  │    │                 │
│  • Axum         │───▶│  • Validation    │───▶│  • In-Memory    │

│  • Actix        │    │  • Multi-tenant  │    │  • Custom       │
│  • Custom       │    │  • Type Safety   │    │                 │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

**HTTP Layer**: Your choice of web framework handles HTTP requests and responses.

**SCIM Server**: The core library handles SCIM protocol logic, validation, multi-tenancy, and type safety.

**Storage**: Pluggable storage providers handle data persistence, from simple in-memory stores to enterprise databases.

## Value Proposition

Instead of building provisioning logic into every application, the SCIM Server centralizes complexity:

| **Without SCIM Server** | **With SCIM Server** |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| ❌ Custom validation in each app | ✅ Centralized validation engine |
| ❌ Manual concurrency control | ✅ Automatic ETag versioning |
| ❌ Manual schema management | ✅ Dynamic schema registry |
| ❌ Ad-hoc API endpoints | ✅ Standardized SCIM protocol |
| ❌ Build multi-tenancy from scratch | ✅ Built-in tenant isolation |

**Result**: Your applications focus on business logic while SCIM Server handles all provisioning complexity.
