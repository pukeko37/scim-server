## 6. Provider Interface Architecture and Capability-Driven Design

### 6.1 Metadata-Driven Provider Architecture

The framework implements a **capability-driven provider interface** that enables clean separation of duties while maximizing provider implementation flexibility. Providers declare their capabilities and schema mappings through metadata, allowing the server to automatically adapt its behavior to provider strengths and limitations.

#### **Core Design Principle: Auto-Discovery Over Configuration**
The framework automatically determines provider capabilities based on implemented traits and declared metadata, rather than requiring external configuration. This ensures the provider interface remains the single source of truth for capabilities and reduces configuration drift.

### 6.2 Provider Capability Declaration

#### **Capability Detection Pattern**
```rust
pub trait MetadataProvider {
    // Required: Provider declares its schema mappings
    fn get_schema_mapping(&self) -> SchemaMapping;
    
    // Optional: Advanced capabilities detected by trait implementation
    fn get_filter_capabilities(&self) -> Option<FilterCapabilities> { None }
    fn get_pagination_capabilities(&self) -> Option<PaginationCapabilities> { None }
    fn get_sort_capabilities(&self) -> Option<SortCapabilities> { None }
    fn get_bulk_capabilities(&self) -> Option<BulkCapabilities> { None }
}
```

#### **Automatic Capability Discovery**
The server automatically detects provider capabilities by:
- **Trait Implementation Detection**: Checking which optional traits the provider implements
- **Metadata Inspection**: Reading capability declarations from provider metadata
- **Runtime Validation**: Testing provider responses to determine actual capabilities

### 6.3 Server Responsibilities (Framework Scope)

#### **SCIM Protocol Layer**
- **Request Parsing**: Parse all SCIM requests including complex filters, pagination, sorting
- **Schema Validation**: Validate requests against SCIM 2.0 specification and provider-declared schemas
- **Response Formatting**: Generate compliant SCIM responses with proper error handling
- **Capability Negotiation**: Automatically adapt behavior based on provider capabilities

#### **Translation and Orchestration**
- **Schema Translation**: Convert SCIM field paths to provider's native field names using declared mappings
- **Filter Decomposition**: Analyze complex SCIM filters and determine what can be optimized by provider
- **Operation Orchestration**: Coordinate between provider-optimized operations and server-side processing
- **Multi-Tenant Routing**: Route tenant-specific requests with proper context injection

#### **Compliance and Consistency**
- **SCIM Specification Adherence**: Ensure all responses meet SCIM 2.0 requirements regardless of provider implementation
- **Error Standardization**: Convert provider errors to standard SCIM error responses
- **Audit Trail Generation**: Log SCIM operations for compliance and debugging
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track operation metrics and performance across tenants

### 6.4 Provider Responsibilities (Implementation Scope)

#### **Data Operations in Native Terms**
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch data using provider's optimal access patterns and field names
- **Data Persistence**: Store and update data in provider's native format and structure
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement efficient queries, caching, and indexing strategies
- **Error Handling**: Return meaningful errors in provider's error model

#### **Capability and Schema Declaration**
- **Schema Mapping**: Declare how SCIM fields map to provider's internal data structure
- **Capability Metadata**: Specify which operations can be optimized (filtering, sorting, pagination)
- **Performance Hints**: Indicate expensive fields, indexed fields, and operation costs
- **Extension Support**: Declare supported SCIM schema extensions and custom attributes

#### **Business Logic Integration**
- **Multi-Tenant Data Isolation**: Implement tenant separation using provider's architecture (separate DBs, row-level security, etc.)
- **External System Integration**: Connect to existing identity systems, databases, APIs
- **Custom Validation**: Apply business-specific validation rules beyond SCIM schema validation
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Implement application-specific user/group lifecycle logic

### 6.5 Capability-Driven Operation Flow

#### **Filter Processing Example**
```
1. Client Request: GET /Users?filter=userName eq "john" and department eq "Engineering" and title co "Manager"

2. Server Actions:
   - Parse SCIM filter into filter tree
   - Check provider.get_filter_capabilities() for supported operations
   - Decompose filter based on provider's declared optimizable fields
   - Determine: userName eq "john" → provider optimizable, rest → server processing

3. Provider Call:
   - Server calls provider.list_users_filtered([UserNameEquals("john")])
   - Provider returns pre-filtered results (e.g., 1 user instead of 10,000)

4. Server Processing:
   - Server applies remaining filter: department eq "Engineering" and title co "Manager"
   - Server formats final SCIM response

5. Result: Optimal performance with guaranteed SCIM compliance
```

#### **Automatic ServiceProviderConfig Generation**
```rust
// Server automatically generates accurate capability advertisement
pub fn generate_service_provider_config<P: MetadataProvider>(provider: &P) -> ServiceProviderConfig {
    let filter_caps = provider.get_filter_capabilities();
    let sort_caps = provider.get_sort_capabilities();
    
    ServiceProviderConfig {
        filter: FilterConfig {
            supported: filter_caps.is_some(),
            max_results: filter_caps.map(|c| c.max_results).unwrap_or(200),
        },
        sort: FeatureConfig {
            supported: sort_caps.is_some(),
        },
        // Configuration always matches actual provider capabilities
    }
}
```

### 6.6 Schema Mapping and Field Translation

#### **Provider Schema Declaration**
```rust
pub struct SchemaMapping {
    // Core field mappings: SCIM path → provider field
    pub field_mappings: HashMap<String, String>,
    
    // Supported schema extensions
    pub supported_extensions: Vec<String>,
    
    // Fields that can be optimized for specific operations
    pub optimizable_fields: HashMap<String, Vec<FilterOperation>>,
    
    // Expensive or computed fields
    pub performance_hints: FieldPerformanceHints,
}

// Example provider implementation
impl MetadataProvider for DatabaseProvider {
    fn get_schema_mapping(&self) -> SchemaMapping {
        SchemaMapping {
            field_mappings: [
                ("userName", "user_name"),
                ("emails.value", "email_address"),
                ("name.givenName", "first_name"),
                ("name.familyName", "last_name"),
                ("urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:employeeNumber", "emp_id"),
            ].into(),
            supported_extensions: vec![
                "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User"
            ],
            optimizable_fields: [
                ("user_name", vec![FilterOperation::Eq, FilterOperation::StartsWith]),
                ("email_address", vec![FilterOperation::Eq, FilterOperation::Contains]),
                ("emp_id", vec![FilterOperation::Eq, FilterOperation::In]),
            ].into(),
            performance_hints: FieldPerformanceHints {
                expensive_fields: vec!["profile_photo_url"], // Avoid unless requested
                indexed_fields: vec!["user_name", "email_address", "emp_id"],
            },
        }
    }
}
```

### 6.7 Boundary Enforcement and Design Principles

#### **Server Never Knows Provider Implementation Details**
- ✅ Server works with SCIM concepts and provider-declared mappings
- ❌ Server never contains provider-specific logic or hardcoded integrations
- ✅ All provider communication goes through declared interfaces and metadata

#### **Provider Never Handles SCIM Protocol Directly**
- ✅ Provider works with native data structures and operations
- ❌ Provider never parses SCIM requests or formats SCIM responses
- ✅ Provider receives translated operations in familiar terms

#### **Capabilities Drive Behavior**
- ✅ Server behavior automatically adapts to provider capabilities
- ❌ No external configuration of what provider "should" support
- ✅ Provider interface is single source of truth for capabilities

#### **Graceful Degradation**
- ✅ Operations work regardless of provider capability level
- ✅ Advanced providers get performance benefits, simple providers still work
- ✅ Server fills gaps in provider capabilities transparently

### 6.8 LLM Implementation Guidelines

When implementing server-provider interactions:

1. **Always Check Capabilities First**: Query provider metadata before attempting operations
2. **Translate All Requests**: Convert SCIM concepts to provider's native terms using declared mappings
3. **Decompose Complex Operations**: Split operations based on provider capabilities, handle remainder in server
4. **Validate Against Metadata**: Ensure operations match provider's declared capabilities
5. **Handle Missing Capabilities**: Provide server-side implementation when provider doesn't support an operation
6. **Maintain SCIM Compliance**: Always return valid SCIM responses regardless of provider behavior
7. **Use Provider Context**: Pass rich tenant context to providers without exposing tenant implementation details

This architecture ensures clean separation while maximizing both provider flexibility and SCIM compliance.

## 11. Multi-Tenant Scope Boundaries Summary

### **Framework's Multi-Tenant Responsibilities**
The SCIM Server Framework provides **multi-tenant SCIM orchestration** that enables one framework instance to serve multiple independent enterprise customers while connecting to a single customer provider implementation:

- ✅ **SCIM Endpoint Isolation**: Independent SCIM endpoints per tenant (`/scim/{tenant}/v2/`)
- ✅ **SCIM Protocol Per Tenant**: Tenant-specific schema validation, custom attributes, error handling
- ✅ **SCIM Operational Policies**: Per-tenant rate limiting, caching, and audit trails for SCIM operations
- ✅ **Tenant Context Orchestration**: Rich tenant context injection to customer's provider implementation
- ✅ **SCIM Compliance Enforcement**: Protocol compliance and security per tenant

### **Customer's Multi-Tenant Responsibilities**
The customer (framework user) implements their application's multi-tenant data and business logic architecture:

- ❌ **Data Architecture**: How to isolate tenant data (separate DBs, shared DB with isolation, service routing)
- ❌ **Business Logic**: Application-specific user lifecycle, workflows, approval processes
- ❌ **Tenant Provisioning**: Customer onboarding, billing, subscription management
- ❌ **External Integrations**: Connecting tenant data with HR systems, directories, APIs

### **Key Architectural Pattern**
```
Multiple Enterprise Customers → Framework Multi-Tenant Orchestration → Single Provider Implementation → Customer's Multi-Tenant Application
```

This boundary ensures the framework focuses on SCIM protocol excellence and multi-tenant orchestration while giving customers complete flexibility in implementing their application's multi-tenant architecture.

## 12. Conclusion

This scope document establishes clear boundaries that maximize framework value while maintaining integration flexibility. The SCIM Server Framework is positioned as essential infrastructure for enterprise SaaS development - a protocol translation and orchestration layer that enables rather than replaces existing identity management systems.

The framework's multi-tenant SCIM orchestration capabilities enable SaaS providers to offer isolated SCIM endpoints to multiple enterprise customers through a single deployment, while maintaining laser focus on SCIM protocol excellence as the primary value proposition.

Success will be measured by developer adoption, enterprise validation, and the growth of a thriving provider ecosystem that demonstrates the framework's flexibility and real-world utility.
