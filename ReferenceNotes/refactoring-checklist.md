## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)

### README.md Refactoring
- [ ] Save current README.md as `ReferenceNotes/README-backup.md`
- [ ] Analyze current README.md content and categorize sections:
  - [ ] Keep: Project description, badges, quick start
  - [ ] Move to guide: Architecture explanations, detailed examples
  - [ ] Move to examples: Complex code samples
  - [ ] Move to reference: Technical specifications
- [ ] Replace current README.md with streamlined version based on template
- [ ] Verify README.md is under 300 lines
- [ ] Test quick start example compiles and runs

### Directory Structure Reorganization
- [ ] Create new directory structure:
  ```
  docs/
  ├── guide/              # mdbook tutorial content (already created)
  ├── reference/          # Technical references 
  │   ├── api-spec/
  │   ├── architecture/
  │   ├── development/
  │   └── migration/
  └── examples/           # Extended examples with explanations
  ```
- [ ] Move existing content to appropriate new locations:
  - [ ] `docs/COMPILE_TIME_AUTHENTICATION.md` → `docs/reference/development/`
  - [ ] `docs/migration-v0.4.md` → `docs/reference/migration/`
  - [ ] `docs/phase-3-storage-implementations.md` → `docs/reference/development/`

  - [ ] Installation and setup
  - [ ] First SCIM server
  - [ ] Basic CRUD operations

  - [ ] Custom resource types
  - [ ] Authentication setup
  - [ ] Performance optimization
  - [ ] Troubleshooting common issues

## Phase 3: API Documentation Enhancement (Week 3)

### Rust Documentation (rustdoc)
- [ ] Audit all public APIs for missing documentation
- [ ] Add comprehensive module-level docs (`//!`) explaining:
  - [ ] Module purpose and scope
  - [ ] How it fits in the overall architecture
  - [ ] Key concepts and terminology
  - [ ] Links to related modules and guide sections
- [ ] Enhance item-level docs (`///`) with:
  - [ ] Clear descriptions of what each item does
  - [ ] `# Examples` sections with runnable code
  - [ ] `# Panics` sections where applicable
  - [ ] `# Errors` sections for Result-returning functions
  - [ ] `# Safety` sections for unsafe functions
- [ ] Add extensive intra-doc links using `[`Type`]` syntax
- [ ] Ensure all doctests compile and pass
- [ ] Enable `#![warn(missing_docs)]` for public APIs

### Cross-Reference Links
- [ ] Add links from rustdoc to guide sections
- [ ] Add links from guide to relevant API documentation
- [ ] Add links from examples to related guide sections
- [ ] Create index of all documentation resources

## Phase 4: Reference Documentation (Week 4)

### Technical Reference Creation
- [ ] Create comprehensive reference documentation:
  - [ ] SCIM protocol compliance details

- [ ] Time-to-first-success metrics for new users
- [ ] Documentation maintenance burden
- [ ] External contributions to documentation
- [ ] Search analytics for most-accessed documentation sections
