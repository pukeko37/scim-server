# SCIM Server Library for Rust

## Project Overview

This project builds a comprehensive **System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) server library** in Rust that enables developers to implement SCIM-compliant identity providers with minimal effort. SCIM is an IETF standard (RFC 7643/7644) for automating user provisioning between cloud applications and identity systems, addressing the critical need for standardized identity management in enterprise environments.

## Core Problem Statement

Organizations today struggle with identity management across multiple cloud services, requiring custom integrations for each provider. SCIM solves this by providing a standardized REST API for user and group provisioning, but implementing a compliant SCIM server requires deep protocol knowledge and careful attention to schema validation, state management, and extensibility requirements.

## Library Design Philosophy

The library follows a **trait-based architecture** where users implement data access patterns while the library handles all SCIM protocol compliance. The design emphasizes:

- **Type-safe state management** using Rust's type system to prevent invalid operations at compile time
- **Dynamic schema registration** supporting custom resource types beyond core User/Group schemas
- **Runtime schema validation** enabling flexible extensions while maintaining protocol compliance
- **Functional programming patterns** with immutable data structures and iterator combinators

## Architecture Overview

The library centers around a **state machine encoded in types** rather than runtime enums, ensuring compile-time safety:

```rust
ScimServer<Uninitialized> 
  → load_schemas() → ScimServer<SchemasLoaded>
  → register_resource_types() → ScimServer<Ready>
```

Users implement a simple `ResourceProvider` trait for data operations:

```rust
trait ResourceProvider {
    async fn create_resource(&self, resource_type: &str, resource: Resource) -> Result<Resource, Error>;
    async fn get_resource(&self, resource_type: &str, id: &str) -> Result<Option<Resource>, Error>;
    // ... other CRUD operations
}
```

The library handles schema loading, validation, HTTP request processing, filter parsing, and response formatting automatically.

## Technical Implementation

**Schema Engine**: Runtime schema registry supporting dynamic resource type registration with full RFC 7643 compliance including attribute characteristics (mutability, uniqueness, case sensitivity).

**Resource Model**: Generic `Resource` type backed by validated JSON with schema-aware attribute access, supporting both core SCIM schemas and custom extensions.

**State Management**: Type-parameterized server states ensuring schemas are loaded before resource operations, with consuming methods preventing invalid state transitions.

**Validation Pipeline**: Multi-layered validation including JSON schema compliance, attribute characteristic enforcement, and custom business rules.

## MVP Scope

The initial implementation focuses on:
- Core User schema with hardcoded definitions
- Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete, List)
- Schema discovery endpoints (`/Schemas`, `/ServiceProviderConfig`)
- Simple equality filtering
- JSON validation against User schema

**Explicitly excluded from MVP**: Groups, complex filtering, bulk operations, authentication, versioning, and custom resource types.

## Development Strategy

The project follows strict **YAGNI principles**, implementing only explicitly required features. The codebase emphasizes:
- **Functional style** with iterator combinators over imperative loops
- **Comprehensive error handling** using `Result<T, E>` types throughout
- **Zero-cost abstractions** leveraging Rust's type system for runtime performance
- **Async-first design** supporting modern Rust patterns

## Expected Deliverables

- Core library crate with trait-based architecture
- Comprehensive documentation with usage examples
- Integration test suite covering SCIM protocol compliance
- Example implementations (in-memory, database-backed)
- Performance benchmarks and optimization guidelines

This library will enable Rust developers to implement enterprise-grade SCIM servers with confidence, knowing that protocol compliance, schema validation, and extensibility are handled automatically while maintaining full control over data storage and business logic.
